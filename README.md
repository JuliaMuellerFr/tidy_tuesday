# My Tidy Tuesday contributions

Collection of my [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) code & plots, many of which were created with [R-Ladies Freiburg](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-freiburg/).

Very much a work in progress - feedback welcome: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/JuliaMuellerFr)
