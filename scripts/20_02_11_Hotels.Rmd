Created at an [R-Ladies Freiburg meetup](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-freiburg/)!

# Data prep
Loading packages:
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(hablar)
library(extrafont)
# Importing more fonts - this takes a few minutes!
# font_import() 
loadfonts(device = "win") # windowsFonts() to list them
```

Reading in data:
```{r}
hotels <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-02-11/hotels.csv')
```

Calculating new variables and changing the factor levels for the meal options:
```{r}
hotels <- hotels %>% 
  filter(is_canceled == 0) %>% 
  mutate(stay = stays_in_weekend_nights + stays_in_week_nights,
         kids = children + babies,
         people = kids + adults
         )
hotels$meal <- plyr::revalue(hotels$meal, c("Undefined" = "No meal package", "SC" = "No meal package", "BB" = "Bed & Breakfast", "HB" = "Half board", "FB" = "Full board"))
hotels$meal <- factor(hotels$meal, levels = c("No meal package", "Bed & Breakfast", "Half board", "Full board"))
summary(hotels$meal)
```

# Plots
```{r}
plot_requests <- hotels %>% 
  filter(people > 0 & kids < 4 & stay < 20 & country == "DEU") %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_jitter(aes(total_of_special_requests, stay, size = people, color = kids)) +
  labs(x = "Total number of special requests made by the guests",
       y = "Days the guest stayed at the hotel",
       title ="Special requests by length of hotel stay",
       subtitle = "German guests only",
       size = "Number of guests",
       color = "Number of children") +
  scale_colour_gradient(low = "#64B8CD", high = "#003345") +
  theme_minimal() +
  facet_grid(vars(hotel), vars(arrival_date_year)) +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 16, family = "Zilla Slab"))

plot_meals <- hotels %>% 
  filter(people > 0 & kids < 4 & stay < 20 & country == "DEU") %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(people, stay, colour = meal, size = kids) +
  geom_jitter() +
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("#64B8CD", "#2D899D", "#005D70", "#003345")) +
  labs(x = "Number of guests",
       y = "Length of stay (in days)",
       title ="Meal options in city and resort hotels",
       subtitle = "German guests only",
       size = "Number of children",
       color = "Meal options") +
  theme_minimal() +
  facet_grid(vars(hotel), vars(arrival_date_year)) +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 16, family = "Zilla Slab"))
