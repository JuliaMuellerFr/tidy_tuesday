Created at an [R-Ladies Freiburg meetup](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-freiburg/)!

# Loading packages
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(extrafont)
# Importing more fonts - this takes a few minutes!
# font_import() 
loadfonts(device = "win") # windowsFonts() to list them
```

# Reading and preparing data
Replacing -1 by NA and converting state to factor:
```{r}
measles <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-02-25/measles.csv')

measles$mmr <- dplyr::na_if(measles$mmr, "-1")
measles$overall <- dplyr::na_if(measles$overall, "-1")

measles$state <- as.factor(measles$state)
```

Creating a new data frame with averages for the different vaccination rates as well as rates for exceptions based on religious, personal, or medical grounds:
```{r}
states <- measles %>% 
    group_by(state) %>% 
    summarise(mean_mmr = mean(mmr, na.rm = TRUE), 
              mean_vacs = mean(overall, na.rm = TRUE),
              count_rel = sum(xrel, na.rm = TRUE),
              mean_pers = mean(xper, na.rm = TRUE),
              mean_med = mean(xmed, na.rm = TRUE),
              mean_excep = mean(c(count_rel, mean_pers, mean_med), na.rm = TRUE)
              )
summary(states)
```

# Plots
```{r}
plot_mmr <- states %>% 
  drop_na(mean_mmr) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = reorder(state, mean_mmr), y = mean_mmr) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = mean_mmr), size = 4) +
  scale_color_gradient(low = "#B10000", high = "#2D1C8C") +
  geom_segment(aes(x = state, xend = state, y = 95, yend = mean_mmr), 
               size = 1, alpha = 0.6) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        text = element_text(size = 12, family = "Constantia")) +

  coord_flip() +
  lims(y = c(80, 100))

plot_all <- states %>% 
  drop_na(mean_vacs) %>% 
  ggplot() +
